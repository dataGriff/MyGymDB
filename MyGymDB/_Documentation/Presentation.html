# Have an idea!

* Don't stress too much over this - anything can be stored in a database
* Think of something that interests you that you know well
* "Ooh me like exercise! I'll do a an exercise thingy"
* So today we're going to make a (very small) gym database

# Source Control

* Keeps all your code in a definitive location (the source)
* Keeps a history of your code and changes you've made
* It's important in the enterprise, it's important for us!
* No excuses anymore, git and github are free

# Create an infrastructure

* Use our local machine for dev with SQL Express
* (Can also use localdb in SSDT for initial dev - see later)
* Use Azure database for production
* Using Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) is very easy!

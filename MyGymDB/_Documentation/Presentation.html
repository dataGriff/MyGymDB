# Have an idea!

* Don't stress too much over this - anything can be stored in a database
* Think of something that interests you that you know well
* "Ooh me like exercise! I'll do a an exercise thingy"
* So today we're going to make a (very small) gym database

---

# Design a database

* Get yourself a paper and pen...

* You'll learn over time, lets just have some fun!

---

# Resources

This is what [today]("hello") is all about, showing you that you can use free
tools from home to make a complete database service from home.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [Github Account](https://github.com/)
* [Team Services Online Account](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)
* [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
* [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=52679)
* [Azure Account] (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html), [Atom] (https://atom.io/)

# Source Control

* Keeps all your code in a definitive location (the source)
* Keeps a history of your code and changes you've made
* It's important in the enterprise, it's important for us!
* No excuses anymore, git and github are free 

---

# Work Management

* Using team services online (up to 5 users) for free
* Create work projects and source control for your code
* User stories, backlog, kanban board, source control..
* Does a heck of a lot more...

---

# Create an infrastructure

* Use our local machine for dev with SQL Express
* (Can also use localdb in SSDT for initial dev - see later)
* Use Azure database for production
* Using Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) is very easy! 

---

# Database Tools

* SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools)
* Database project in visual studio community edition 
* A lot of functionality e.g. schema compare, data compare 
* Allows you to check in your code to source control
* Link you code with user stores
* State based so changes being made are easy

---

# Build your database

* 

---

# Deploy your database

* SSDT Demo:
* Deploying a database

---

# Demo 

* Set up Visual Studio Team Services Project 
* Add user story as work 
* Link project to visual studio 
* Develop objects
* Build and Publish
* Check in your code and link with user story 

---

Bask in the glory of what we have achieved!

---

# Immerse yourself

* Mess around with free tools
* Come to the user group sessions (meetup.com, SQL, .Net, Agile and many more!)
* Look at training material
* Force your bosses to get you books
* Have fun!
